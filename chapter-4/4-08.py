# Cubes: A number raised to the third power is called a cube. For example,
# the cube of 2 is written as 2**3 in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that
# is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a for loop to print out
# the value of each cube.

cubes = [1**3, 2**3, 3**3, 4**3, 5**3, 6**3, 7**3, 8**3, 9**3, 10**3]

for cube in cubes:
    print(cube)
