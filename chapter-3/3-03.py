# Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that
# stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as "I would like to
# own a Honda motorcycle."

vehicles = ['car', 'motorcycle', 'vespa', 'scooter']

print(f"I have always wanted to drive a {vehicles[0]}, but could never afford one. I have always used my {vehicles[3]}"
      f"in place of a {vehicles[0]}. Now that I have a sweet programming job, I went to my local motorcycle shop."
      f" Unfortunately, they were all out of {vehicles[1]}s, so now I am stuck with a {vehicles[2]}.")
