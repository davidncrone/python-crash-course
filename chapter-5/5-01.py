# Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# •	 Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
#    evaluates to True or False.
# •	 Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
#    another five tests evaluate to False.

car = 'subaru'
motorcycle = 'honda'
truck = 'nissan'
sport_car = 'corvette'
num = 15
guitar = 'electric'
piano = 'electric'
bulb = 'led'
drinking_age = 21
sleep = 'good'
coffee = 'awesome'

print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("Is motorcycle == 'yamaha'? I predict False.")
print(motorcycle == 'yamaha')

print("Is truck == 'nissan'? I predict True.")
print(truck == 'nissan')

print("Is sport car == 'dodge'? I predict False.")
print(sport_car == 'dodge')

print("Is num > 10? I predict True.")
print(num > 10)

print("Is guitar == 'acoustic'? I predict False.")
print(guitar == 'acoustic')

print("Is bulb == 'led'? I predict True.")
print(bulb == 'led')

print("Is drinking age < 21? I predict False.")
print(drinking_age < 21)

print("Is sleep == 'good'? I predict True.")
print(sleep == 'good')

print("Is coffee == 'awesome'? I predict True.")
print(coffee == 'awesome')
